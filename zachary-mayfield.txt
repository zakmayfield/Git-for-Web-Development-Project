  a class is different from an id because we can use the same class as many times as we'd like we'd like on an HTML document. An example of each one would be having each <p> use the class of bold (<p class="bold"></p>). We could then go into css, select .bold and set the font-weight. BUT if we wanted one specific paragraph to be bold AND italicized we could do this: 
  <p class="bold" id="ital"><p> Then all of the paragraphs would be bold but this one paragraph would be bold and italic.

Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

  Inline element share the same row with other elements like a <span>
  <span> <span> <span> 

  Block level element take up the whole row and do not share rows and essentially "stack"
  <div>
  <div>
  <div>


2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

  An aboslutely positioned element will ignore the flow of the document, and other elements will do the same to it. Essentially acting as if it is invisible and does not take up space in the normal flow.


3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

  display: inline-block


4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

  <div> / <section> / <nav>
  <img> / <span>
  <li>


5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

  The box model is the size of the space surrounding and consuming the content. So height + border + padding + margin = actual height.

  This sucks.

  The fix for the box model is using:
  *{
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  This makes the acutal height = not equaling padding and margin.
